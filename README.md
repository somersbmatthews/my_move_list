## My Movie List
##### This website is available for use at: 
https://my-movie-list-sierra.herokuapp.com/users/register


#### What is this?
<p>This was created so a user can store and manage a list of all of the movies they want to be able to see. </p>


#### After creating an account a user is able to:
* Set their favorite genres, actors, actresses, directors, producers, in preferences
* A user is shown a random selection of popular movies, their favorite genres, and their favorite actors in the browse page
* A user can search for movies off of a variety of criteria (title keywords, genre, minimum rating, person keywords)
* Users can click on specific titles to view more information about the movie
* Users can add movies to their watch list to keep track of their favorites
* Users can manage their watchlist be removing movies they have seen.


#### What technologies were used?
<p>We used, JavaScript, Node.js, Css, EJS, Mongoose, Express.js, MongoDB, and a movie database API (see below).
<br>
   This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

#### Who created this project and why?
The following collaborators contributed to this project:   
	Anthony Lower @ https://github.com/anthonyjlower    
	Sierra Moore @ https://github.com/sierramoore  
	Somers Matthews @ https://github.com/somersbmatthews  

We wanted to create a CRUD app that allows for multiple API calls in sequence that provide useful information to the user.


##### Future Goals:

* Add selected movies to their “Already watched list”
* Rate and review movies they have watched
* See recommendations on their homepage based off of their watched history
* See other users ratings and reviews on the movie specific pages 
* Able to add additional criteria to preferences
